# CTI-Dashboard
This project is a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Dashboard built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It pulls data from the AbuseIPDB public API, filters and displays it in a user-friendly interface with charts and tables.

Features:
- Filter by Indicator Type (e.g., IP)
- Choose Number of Entries (10, 100, 500, 1000, or all)
- Bar Chart Visualization of top threats by country
- Responsive UI with optional background image styling

Requirements:
- XAMPP (or any local PHP server)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- AbuseIPDB API Key (Free to register)

Troubleshooting:
- File Not Found Error? --> Run fetch.php at least once before loading index.php
- No Data or Empty Chart? --> Double-check your API key
- Ensure your internet connection is active when calling the API
